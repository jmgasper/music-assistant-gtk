## Configuration

### Connecting to Music Assistant Server

- This app requires a running Music Assistant server (version 2.x).
- Default server URL is `http://localhost:8095`.
- Open the settings panel by clicking the Settings button in the sidebar.
- Configure the Server URL and Authentication Token fields.

### Generating an API Token

1. Open the Music Assistant web interface (typically `http://localhost:8095`).
2. Navigate to Settings > Security > Long-Lived Access Tokens.
3. Click "Create Token".
4. Give the token a descriptive name (for example, "GTK Client").
5. Copy the generated token.
6. Paste the token into the GTK app's settings panel.
7. Click "Connect" to establish the connection.

### Settings Persistence

- Settings are saved to `settings.json` in the application directory.
- The file stores the server URL and authentication token.
- Settings are automatically loaded on application startup.

## Running the Application

### Starting the App

```bash
python main.py
```

### Debug Mode

```bash
MA_DEBUG=1 python main.py
```

- Enables verbose logging for troubleshooting.
- Shows detailed information about library loading, playback events, and Sendspin connection.
- Add `MA_DEBUG_RESPONSES=1` alongside `MA_DEBUG=1` to include raw Music Assistant request/response payloads.
- Add `SENDSPIN_DEBUG=1` to enable Sendspin + GStreamer pipeline debug logs without turning on full `MA_DEBUG`.

### First Run

- On first launch, configure the server connection in Settings.
- After connecting, the app automatically loads your library.
- Albums, artists, and playlists appear in the sidebar.

### Testing Playback

- Browse to Albums or the Home section.
- Click an album to view details.
- Click the play button or double-click a track to start playback.
- Use playback controls in the top bar.
- Select an audio output device using the output selector button.

### MPRIS Integration

- Media keys (play/pause, next, previous) work automatically.
- Desktop notifications and media player integrations work via D-Bus.
- Control playback from system media controls.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

| Issue | Solution |
| --- | --- |
| "Cannot connect to server" | Verify the Music Assistant server is running and accessible at the configured URL. Check firewall settings. |
| "Authentication failed" | Regenerate the API token in the Music Assistant web interface and update it in the app settings. |
| No audio output | Check GStreamer installation: `gst-inspect-1.0 autoaudiosink`. Verify audio device selection in the output selector. |
| Sendspin connection fails | Ensure port 8927 is accessible. Check Music Assistant server logs for Sendspin errors. |
| Album art not loading | Check network connectivity. Clear the cache directory (`.cache/`) and restart the app. |
| GTK warnings/errors | Ensure GTK 4 and PyGObject are properly installed. Check `MA_DEBUG=1` output for details. |

### Development Notes

- The application uses GTK 4 with libadwaita-style components.
- All UI components are designed to be under 300 lines for maintainability.
- Image loading is asynchronous using ThreadPoolExecutor to prevent UI blocking.
- Playback state is synchronized between local UI and the Music Assistant server.
- The Sendspin protocol handles audio streaming over WebSocket with PCM format support.
- MPRIS implementation follows the MPRIS D-Bus Interface Specification 2.2.

### Code Organization Principles

- Each module has a single, well-defined responsibility.
- UI components are separated from business logic.
- Music Assistant integration is isolated in the `music_assistant/` directory.
- Shared utilities and constants are in root-level files.
- The method binding pattern in `main.py` allows clean separation while maintaining app context.
